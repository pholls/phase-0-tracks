#Robot Elevator Algorithm:
If the door is open:
  -Enter the elevator
  If you cannot see the buttons:
    -Turn until you can see the buttons
If the door is not open:
  -Push the button next to the door.
  -Wait until the door is open
  -Enter the elevator.
  If you cannot see the buttons:
    -Turn until you can see the buttons
Once inside the elevator:
  -Until the number on the button = the number of the floor you want to go to:
    -Do not push the button
    -Locate the next button (the current number + 1):
      -Look to the right of the current button.
      -If this button = current button +1, continue.
      -If there is no button to the right of current button:
        -Return to current button
        -look above the current button.
          -If new button = current button +1, continue.
          -If new button = current button + >1, look to the left of new button.
            -until left_of_new_button = current button +1, move left.
  -If the button number = the floor number you want
    -push the button
    -Wait until the doors close
    -Wait until the doors open
  -When the doors open:
    -Look for the current floor number
    -If current floor number < the floor number you wanted:
      -Wait until door closes.
      -Wait until door opens.
    -If current floor number > the floor number you wanted:
      -Wait until door closes.
      -Wait until door opens.
    -If current floor number = the floor number you wanted:
      -Exit elevator.
