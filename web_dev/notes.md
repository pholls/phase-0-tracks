#jQuery learning plan

##Resources
###[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/jquery)
####Pros:
* Good introduction to the material
* Have learned a lot from previous Codecademy lessons

####Cons:
* Only one track -- easy to get hung up on their style as the only "right" way
* Time-consuming
* Guided track means less room for creative exploration

###[W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/)
####Pros:
* Self-guided = room for creative exploration

####Cons:
* W3 schools isn't the best resource

###[jQuery Fundamentals](http://jqfundamentals.com/legacy/)
####Pros:
* In-depth

####Cons:
* Easy to get sucked in (time sink/rabbit hole)

##Notes
* *jQuery Fundamentals* seemed to be more of a classroom-guided resource
* I enjoyed Codecademy's jQuery track
* W3 Schools was a good resource to explore jQuery in a more self-guided way
* wrap all jQuery methods inside a document ready event to prevent code from running before the document is finished loading
  * this also allows you to put your `<script>` tag in the HTML `<head>` tag
* The best way to learn jQuery will be to practice with it a lot
