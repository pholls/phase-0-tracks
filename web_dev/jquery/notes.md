#jQuery learning plan

##Resources
###[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/jquery)
####Pros:
* Good introduction to the material
* Have learned a lot from previous Codecademy lessons

####Cons:
* Only one track -- easy to get hung up on their style as the only "right" way
* Time-consuming
* Guided track means less room for creative exploration

###[W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/)
####Pros:
* Self-guided = room for creative exploration

####Cons:
* W3 schools isn't the best resource

###[jQuery Fundamentals](http://jqfundamentals.com/legacy/)
####Pros:
* In-depth

####Cons:
* Easy to get sucked in (time sink/rabbit hole)
