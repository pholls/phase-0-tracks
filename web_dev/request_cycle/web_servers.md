#Linux Philosophies
* **Treat all users with respect** (The Prime Directive)
* Treat all users equally
* Allow all users the maximum amount of power (complete control)
* Preventing a user from doing stupid things also prevents them from doing clever things

#VPS (Virtual Private Server)
A VPS is a virtual machine (VM) that serves a webpage. It is different from a traditional server in that it is not a dedicated physical machine, but acts like one. It runs a copy of an operating system. It is a small section of memory on a larger device that acts like a dedicated server.

##Advantages
* Cheaper
* Safer (if you accidentally mess something up you can start over easily without destroying an expensive machine)
* Better control (complete root accessibility)
* Efficient use of resources
* Increased stability and dependability
* Scalable - pay only for what you need

##Disadvantages
* Performance may be lower
