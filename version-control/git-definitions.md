# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control is a system to keep multiple versions of something (code) organized. It is useful to provide backups and eliminate conflicts.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is a cloned copy of existing files or directories. You would use one to prevent deleting or changing the master branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - Short answer: a commit is a save. When you commit your changes in git, you save them and create a reference point to return to. A good commit message is concise, informative, and specific.
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict occurs when changes have been made on the exact same part of the same file -- such as the exact same line. Git has trouble determining which change should be used.
